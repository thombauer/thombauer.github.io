In my cases the battle of analytical tools was decided. I prefered R over Python and only used SAS when I had to, occasionally running and adapting procedures for clients working with SAS. Later I had to decide for an visualization platform and prefered Tableau over SAS Visual Analytics for every single consideration I took into account. 

With SAS Viya I now have the opportunity to change my views and let SAS Visual Analytics convince me. When I thought of SAS I imagined a slow moving enterprise solution like SPSS, when it comes to visualizations I thought of excel and powerpoint in the 1990s.
