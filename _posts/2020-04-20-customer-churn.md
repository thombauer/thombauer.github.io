Today I'd like to share the managment summary to my Certification of Advanced Studies degree, I received in 2020. At the information technology department of Lucerne university of applied sciences I completed my studies in Big Data Analytics with a thesis on customer churn supported by a leading swiss health insurance company. The thesis is confidential, I cannot blog about specitic content, but I want to share some thoughts on the process and some interesting insights.
