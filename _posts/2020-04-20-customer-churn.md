Curious about data science approaches to real life cases I started my CAS in Big Data Analytics in 2019. Today I'd like to share the management summary to my Certification of Advanced Studies degree, I received in 2020. At the information technology department of Lucerne university of applied sciences I completed my studies in Big Data Analytics with a thesis on customer churn supported by a leading swiss health insurance company. The thesis is confidential, I cannot blog about specitic content, but I want to share some thoughts on the process and some interesting insights. 
First of all students were asked to find supporting companies and work on real life problems with the companies databases. We decided to tackle customer churn and used the companies CRM, combined with invoices, free to use market research information and published price trend data in health insurance sector in Switzerland.
