Ethics in algorithms are one of a few hype topics in data science at the moment. Ethics comes often combined with explainability of machine learning models. When ethical ml algorithms come into our minds we often think about self driving cars calculating the value of two lives against another, killer drones deciding whom to kill or facebook's algorithms being game changers in electional campaigns. 
Decisions of algorithms changing our lives in one or another direction have become pervasive and we can tackle ethics in ml on a much more ordinary level. The story of algorithms learning racist or discriminating behavior from human decisions in products of insurance companies is long told. The self-fulfilling prophecy of predictive policing in some neighborhoods and media algorithms in the war on humane attention are other examples from the dark side. The latest summit on AI hosted by the International Social Security Association showed that governmental organisations are well aware of the problem trying to work on it in different ways while expanding their endeavors deploying more and more algorithms.

A growing number of small and medium companies using ml algorithms oblige on codes of ethics while data driven companies built up specific knowledge on ethical questions in data usage. These codes emphasis on end-to-end coordination of data related processes, data governance as management principle and the responsibility of data scienctist training ml models. They are designed to help with decision on different levels of involvement and stimulate discussions on etical questions when using data in a business model. (who doesn't?)

Philosopher Richard David Precht takes a slightly different position when thinking about AI. He emphasizes that ethical programming means crossing a tremendous border. Moral decisions induce highly emotional humane reactions, algorithms on the other side are non-emotional by design and incapable of these kinds of free decisions. Precht works with the example of self driving cars in extreme situations calculating the value of a live against another to decide which pedestrian to kill. Self driving cars are often seen as chance to dramatically reduce traffic death rates but Precht states there are other possibilies like less traffic or slower driving. Gradings in a life's value are not protected by constitutions for some good reason. Precht demands for red lines in every situation AI decides on the loves of humans.

To dive much deeper into an important debate I recommend reading the interview with Richard David Precht in T3N61/2020 and to participate in debates on ethical AI in your industry.

***Thank you, and have a beautiful day!***
