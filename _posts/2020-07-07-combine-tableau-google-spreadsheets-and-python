To find useful data for modeling metrics that really are part of my life, I decided to order the recordings from my Withings Steel HR smartwatch and to have a look what I'm able to do with the raw data. I'm sure you can download the data of your fitness tracker and depending on the format you get you will have to do some data preparation to get useful data.

## Data Collection and Preparation

First I took the collection of the steps I made with my Withings Smartwatch from a csv-file Withings sent me. As I mentioned I have to process the data, what I want to show you in this blog. I hope this encourages you, to gain more insights from the data all the smart tools collect.


## Google Spreadsheets

To be honest I had to cheat and follow a great step-by-step guide I found here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-read-and-write-data-to-google-spreadsheet-using-python-ebf54d51a72c. Since Tableau Public 

## Tableau Public

Tableau is a leading tool when it comes to Dashboarding and Visualization. I use it since 5 years, mainly to build market research dashboards but now I want to show you how to utilize Tableau Public to visualize data coming from Google Spreadsheets. Tableau Desktop (Public) is a free tool you download from https://public.tableau.com, add your own account and get started. As mentioned in the Google Spreadsheets section with Tableau Public you pay with the data you upload to their platform, so be careful with sensitive data.
When the installation process is finished and you have your free profile on https://public.tableau.com you can start to connect the Google Spreadsheet you built in the previous steps. You select connection to a server and then to Google Spreadsheets. In the dialog select your Google account and work your way thru to your saved Google Spreadsheets. When you successfully connected Tableau Desktop to your Google account you can select a Spreadsheet in the Tableau Desktop dialog.
