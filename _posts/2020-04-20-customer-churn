Curious about data science approaches to real life cases I started my CAS in Big Data Analytics in 2019. Today I'd like to share the management summary to my Certification of Advanced Studies degree, I received in 2020. At the information technology department of Lucerne university of applied sciences I completed my studies in Big Data Analytics with a thesis on customer churn supported by a leading swiss health insurance company. The thesis is confidential, I cannot blog about specitic content, but I want to share some thoughts on the process and some interesting insights. 

First of all students were asked to find supporting companies and work on real life problems with the companies databases. We decided to tackle customer churn and used the companies CRM, combined with invoices, free to use market research information and published price trend data in health insurance sector in Switzerland. We used this huge amount of strictly anonymized data, tagged with a variable "churn" (yes/no) and hundreds of raw data features to help marketing to better understand the process of customer churn. We identified groups of churners on various paths from clients to churning customers and gave insights about further modeling in these differing groups.

Insurance companies in Switzerland hardly differ from each other in terms of the legally required insurance benefits in the basic health insurance. It is therefore very easy for clients to obtain comparative information about different insurance providers and to change their own insurer. In this highly dynamic competitive environment with a central annual date for changing basic insurance, there is a lot of movement through large-scale marketing campaigns by insurers. Since the benefits are the same, the comparison of the various insurers is mainly based on premiums and customer service. Every autumn, the topic of changing insurers is taken up again in the media by the OKP and the reasons for changing insurers lie in the premiums that an insured can save. Since the OKP and the supplementary insurance do not have to be with the same insurer, existing supplementary insurance policies do not speak against a change.
