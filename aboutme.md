Hello, I'm Thom — a passionate Data Scientist, experienced Product Owner, and AI/ML Product Manager with a strong focus on Machine Learning applications and data-driven solutions.

With a master’s degree in Sociology and Psychology, complemented by advanced university certifications in Data Science and Machine Learning, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to every project. Over the past two decades, I’ve combined deep technical expertise with strategic leadership, delivering impactful solutions across Data, IT, and ML domains.

My career spans more than 15 years in leadership and Developer roles, where I’ve developed analytical solutions, built and scaled high-performing teams, guided end-to-end ML product development, and consistently delivered business value through data innovation. As a programmer and analyst, I have successfully implemented complex, real-world ML and analytics projects for a wide range of clients. 

In addition to my hands-on experience, I am also passionate about sharing knowledge. I have had the privilege of presenting at congresses and conferences, lecturing in university programs and leading practical training sessions for non-technical professionals.

My passion for AI lies in its potential to solve real business problems. I stay actively engaged with the latest scientific advancements and industry trends, ensuring I remain at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field. I also collaborate closely with companies and research institutions to promote knowledge exchange and accelerate the deployment of AI solutions that make a measurable impact.
